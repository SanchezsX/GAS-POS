# I did this project with (React, TS, Redux, Supabase, Framer-motion, Tailwind)
I'm excited to share a project I've been working on designed for cashiers. This web application allows cashiers to log in, view their orders, and track their daily performance. Each order is recorded in a database, and sessions are refreshed every 24 hours. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, it aims to streamline their workflow and enhance productivity.
